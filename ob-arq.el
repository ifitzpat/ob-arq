;;; Commentary:
;;
;; call docker build on org babel block
;;

;;; Requirements:


;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
;(require 'ob-ref)
;(require 'ob-comint)
;(require 'ob-eval)
(require 'dockerfile-mode)

;; possibly require modes required for your language
(define-derived-mode docker-build-mode dockerfile-mode "docker-build"
  "Major mode for building docker containers from org-babel."
  )


;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:docker-build '((:context . nil)(:tag . nil)(:push . nil)))

;; This function expands the body of a source code block by doing
;; things like prepending argument definitions to the body, it should
;; be called by the `org-babel-execute:docker-build' function below.
(defun org-babel-expand-body:docker-build (body params &optional processed-params)
  "Expand BODY according to PARAMS, return the expanded body."
  ;(require 'inf-docker-build) : TODO check if needed
  body ; TODO translate params to yaml variables
)

;; This is the main function which is called to evaluate a code
;; block.
;;
;; This function will evaluate the body of the source code and
;; return the results as emacs-lisp depending on the value of the
;; :results header argument
;; - output means that the output to STDOUT will be captured and
;;   returned
;; - value means that the value of the last statement in the
;;   source code block will be returned
;;
;; The most common first step in this function is the expansion of the
;; PARAMS argument using `org-babel-process-params'.
;;
;; Please feel free to not implement options which aren't appropriate
;; for your language (e.g. not all languages support interactive
;; "session" evaluation).  Also you are free to define any new header
;; arguments which you feel may be useful -- all header arguments
;; specified by the user will be available in the PARAMS variable.
(defun org-babel-execute:docker-build (body params)
  "Execute a block of docker-build code with org-babel.
This function is called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'"
